# CI Disabled - Complex dependency setup was causing issues
# 
# If you want to re-enable CI later, you can restore the previous workflow
# or create a simpler one with just basic checks.
#
# To completely remove CI:
# 1. Delete this file: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# 2. Or replace with a minimal workflow below
